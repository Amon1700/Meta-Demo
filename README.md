Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of building blocks to create custom designs without any opinionated styles that need to be overridden. It allows developers to build websites with a clean and consistent UI out of the box, and it integrates well with any web development framework because it's just CSS.
